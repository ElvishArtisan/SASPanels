This software is BETA code.  As such, it is likely to contain bugs, 
possibly serious ones.  Use with caution!

SASPanels is a utility that provides a computer-based simulation of a
single output SAS control module (similar to that provided by a
CPI-80), commonly used for controlling one of the audio router systems 
manufactured by Sierra Automated Systems.  It uses SAS's 'Universal 
Serial Interface' (USI) protocol to communicate with the central 
routing matrix by means of TCP/IP connection over a network.  
Instructions for building and installing the program can be found in 
the 'INSTALL' file.  For help in running the program, simply do:

    sas_single --help

after the program is installed.

SASPanels also has the ability to restrict which router inputs are
available for routing to a given output.  These restrictions are
defined in the '/etc/saspanels.conf' file.  A sample of this file,
containing instructions on it's format and use, is included in the
SASPanels package.

Good luck!
