This is the installation file for the SASPanels package.

PREREQUISITES
You will need the following installed and configured properly on your 
system before building Rivendell:

X11 Window System
Virtually all Linux distros should include this.

Qt Toolkit, v3.2 or better
Most modern Linux distros include this.  It's typically installed as part
of the KDE Desktop Environment, although KDE is by no means required.
It can also be downloaded directly from TrollTech (http://www.trolltech.com/).

The libradio Radio Library -- v0.96.0 or greater.
This is a class library that contains much of the 'generic'
functionality used by Rivendell (and other packages beside).  See
ftp://ftp.salemradiolabs.com/pub/srlabs/libradio/.

Once the prerquisites are satisfied, installation is largely a matter
of doing the following in the top-level source directory:

   ./configure
   make
   make install		(as root)

Once installed, a usage message explaining the parameters that need to
be supplied when invoking the program can be display by doing:

   sas_single --help

SASPanels also has the ability to restrict which router inputs are
available for routing to a given output.  These restrictions are
defined in the '/etc/saspanels.conf' file.  A sample of this file,
containing instructions on it's format and use, is included in the
SASPanels package.
